Making flat 3D SMLM images, coloured by z-position

I often forget how to do this, so I will write it here for, at the very least, my own sake.

1. Get your 3D data open in ThunderSTORM (process something or import something)
2. Click the 'Visualisation' button
    a. Set Magnification to something nice, like 10
    b. Set your z-range to something a bit tight so that your data are spread out across the full 'spectrum' of your LUT.
    c. Uncheck 'colorize by Z'
    d. Generate the image
3. Click Image > Hyperstack > Temporal Color Code
    a. It should tell you that your slices and your frames have been switched. You can do this yourself beforehand via Image > Hyperstack > Re-order Hyperstack if you wish.
    b. Select your favourite LUT from the menu and click Apply.
    c. You should get a new image window with the flattened, coloured-by-z image.

The images in this folder were created with:
Z range (from:step:to)[nm] = -200:10:250 i.e. all colour bars in this folder cover this range ... the Temporal Color Coding puts a frame number in the colour bar.
Magnification=10
Method=Normalized Gaussian
