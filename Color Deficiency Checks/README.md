# Color Deficiency Checks

These images were created in FiJi (ImageJ2) using the Image > Color > Dichromacy plugin and help to highlight how some LUTs are useless for people with colour vision deficiency (CVD), which is around 8% of men and 0.5% of women.

I have quickly rated these LUTs for obvious problems in the CVD-filtered images. These ratings do not take into account other factors that might make a LUT suitable, such as greyscale conversion, or perceptual uniformity.

I would certainly appreciate any feedback from people with colour vision deficiency as to which images are good or bad!

## Broad Visibility
The spectrum remains smooth and separable across all the filters.

### Parula

## Passable Visibility
The colours are generally separable but there might be problems like colour reuse or lack of definition within parts of the spectrum.

### CharleyHorse

### VioletCrumble
![VioletCrumble LUT](VioletCrumble%20Montage.png?raw=true "VioletCrumble LUT")

### DavFire
![DavFire LUT](DavFire%20Montage.png?raw=true "DavFire LUT")

### Jet
![Jet LUT](Jet%20Montage.png?raw=true "Jet LUT")

## Poor Visibility
Here it becomes very difficult to tell parts of the spectrum apart

### Bubblegum
