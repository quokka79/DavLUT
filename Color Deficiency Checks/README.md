# Color Deficiency Checks

These images were created in FiJi (ImageJ2) using the Image > Color > Dichromacy plugin and help to highlight how some LUTs are useless for around 8% of men and 0.5% of women with colour vision deficiency (CVD).

I have quickly rated these LUTs for obvious problems in the CVD-filtered images. These ratings do not take into account other factors that might make a LUT suitable, such as greyscale conversion, or perceptual uniformity.

I would certainly appreciate any feedback from people with colour vision deficiency as to which images are good or bad!

## Broad Visibility
The spectrum remains smooth and separable across all the filters.

![Candy LUT](Candy Montage.png?raw=true "Candy LUT")
![Candy Bright LUT](Candy Bright Montage.png?raw=true "Candy Bright LUT")
![DavLUT LUT](DavLUT Montage.png?raw=true "DavLUT LUT")
![DavLUT Bright LUT](DavLUT Bright Montage.png?raw=true "DavLUT Bright LUT")
![Parula LUT](Parula Montage.png?raw=true "Parula LUT")
![PeachPassion LUT](PeachPassion Montage.png?raw=true "PeachPassion LUT")

## Passable Visibility
The colours are generally separable but there might be problems like colour reuse or lack of definition within parts of the spectrum.

![DavFire LUT](DavFire Montage.png?raw=true "DavFire LUT")
![Jet LUT](Jet Montage.png?raw=true "Jet LUT")

## Poor Visibility
Here it becomes very difficult to tell parts of the spectrum apart
